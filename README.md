# 🖥️ Terminal README 🇲🇦 (Moroccan National Day Edition)

**Welcome to Terminal!** In honor of Moroccan National Day, we’ve given this README a special Moroccan twist. Bringing the souk vibes to your desktop terminal – it’s a bit like a Moroccan bazaar but with more commands and fewer spices. Download it, test it out, and see if you can handle all that Moroccan-style tech magic. Bismillah, let’s go!

## 📥 Download Instructions (Bismillah!)

1. **Username**:
   - Head to our [download page](https://filenfolder.github.io/download.html).
   - Drop your username (Discord handle, nickname, or just something Moroccan like *Ayoub1998*).
   - Click **Submit** and watch the magic unfold – like your first cup of atay, but with more code.

2. **Choose Your Version (Choose your Zwin)**:
   - **Beta Pre-Classic 1.0** - Basic commands, for that minimalism like a fresh pot of Moroccan tea with just the right sugar level.
   - **Beta Pre-Classic 2.0** - More commands on the way (they’re just taking their time, Moroccan style).
   - **Alpha Classic 1.0.1** - *Coming soon!* More commands and customization, like adding mint to tea – it’s all about flavor.

3. **Installation**:
   - Download the `.exe` file for your chosen version – think of it like taking your freshly baked msemen home.
   - Double-click to start the installer (or, as we say, “just daba daba!”).
   - Follow the on-screen steps, and you’re ready to roll!

4. **Launch**:
   - Open **Wizard Terminal** from your desktop or start menu, and let the Moroccan-style magic begin.
